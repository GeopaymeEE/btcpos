# btcPOS

btcPOS is a simple mobile-friendly Point-of-Sale page that merchants can use to accept Bitcoin payments.

# How it Works

* You create an account and configure some basic parameters for your storefront like a name, logo, and bitcoin receiving address
* You set an exchange rate to be used to convert from your local currency to bitcoin
* btcPOS creates a custom webpage that you can bring up on a mobile device to generate payment requests
* You enter a sale amount in your local currency and btcPOS converts it to bitcoin using your chosen exchange rate
* btcPOS creates a QR code for the payment request with your receiving address and the sale amount encoded
* btcPOS listens for transactions on the Bitcoin network and displays a notification when the requested amount is received at your address
* The details of the transaction and the exchange rate used at the time of sale are recorded and made available in a convenient report

# Technical Details

The site is programmed in HTML and Coffeescript using NodeJS and jQuery. Account details and transaction data are stored in a Redis database.  Users are responsible for providing their own receiving addresses managed with whatever wallet they prefer, so btcPOS never stores any bitcoins.

We use the websocket payment notification API from http://blockchain.info/api/api_websocket to listen for and display payment notifications in real time. The bitcoin exchange rates are fetched from http://bitcoinaverage.com/

# Installation

Install nodeJS (http://nodejs.org/) and redis (http://redis.io/).  On Ubuntu, this would be:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs redis-server
    sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

Download and configure CoinOS:

    git clone https://github.com/thebitcoincoop/coinos
    cd coinos
    npm install  
    node app.js

Now the app should be runnning at http://localhost:3000/
